     THIS IS CHEATING:
     the LLVM docs define the second field of a jmpbuf to be an opaque value produced by llvm.eh.sjlj.setjmp and consumed by llvm.eh.sjlj.longjmp, with its specific semantics being target-specific and not guaranteed to be usable in any particular way other than as described. on x86_64 it happens to just be the address to jump to, and it seems likely that it's the same or similar on other platforms, but at least in principle, this is not a 100% documented and officially-correct use of these intrinsics.
